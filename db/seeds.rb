# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# post = Post.new(title: "Dziady", body: "Welcome to my word")
# post.save

# post = Post.new(title: "Calm down", body: "Josh is here so sh......")
# post.save

# post = Post.new(title: "Day3", body: "lalalalalalalalalalalalalalala")
# post.save
